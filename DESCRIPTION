Description: Translates a 'BNF' ('Backus'-'Naur' Form) specification of a 
             context-free language into an R grammar object
             which consists of the start symbol, the symbol table, 
             the production table, and a short production table.
             The short production table is non-recursive. 
             The grammar object contains the file name from 
             which it was generated (without a path).
             In addition, it provides functions to determine the type 
             of a symbol ('isTerminal' and 'isNonterminal') and functions
             to access the production table ('rules' and 'derives').
